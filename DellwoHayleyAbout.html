<h1>About the Author</h1>

<p>I'm Hayley, I'm 27, and I live in Florida. I live with two cats, two parakeets, and five dogs. When I'm not playing video games, I'm practicing my programming, talking to my friends, or playing with my pets. I enjoy modding video games and sometimes I build my own mods if I can't find something I like.</p>
<p>My first role-playing game was Oblivion in high school on the Xbox 360. I played Fallout 3 and New Vegas shortly after and fell in love with the franchise! I played Fallout 4 on launch for the PC and have 1,000 hours put into it I love it so much. The games have exposed me to music and culture I previously would not have taken an interest in and I'm very grateful for that. I want to play the original two games more (I'm very unfamiliar with isometric games) to better understand where the games originally came from. I am forever sad that Van Buren, Black Isle's original Fallout 3, never got made and released.</p>
